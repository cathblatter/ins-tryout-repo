The goal of ins-tryout-repo is to provide a sample repository where
people can take first steps with git on GitHub.

*This public repo needs to be forked for modification. If you are
collaborating on a private repo where you have direct access the fork is
not necessary.*

## Prerequisites

For this to work I assume you have

1)  a basic understanding of what git & github are

2)  git installed on your machine and

3)  set up a GitHub profile.

An excellent resource for setting it up with R and RStudio is:

-   <https://happygitwithr.com/>

-   <https://rfortherestofus.com/2021/02/how-to-use-git-github-with-r/>

Other resources I found worthwhile are:

-   Presentation on the most important git terminology:

# Workflow to try out

1)  Fork this repository (aka make a copy from the folder from my
    account to yours)

2)  Clone it to your computer (aka download to your local machine), open
    the `.Rproj` file and e.g. add another R-Script with random content.

3)  Commit your changes locally (aka tell git that changes occurred and
    you want to save them) and push (aka upload) back to GitHub, the
    remote repository.

4)  Start a pull request (PR) from your repository back to mine. Assign
    me as a reviewer and I will have a look at them before merging back.

## Why should I do this?

This is a pretty standard situation and I think its a good idea to do
‘dry runs’ here instead of messing up the analysis of your colleagues
(or yourself).

## Disclaimer

This repo was set up for use for people (collaborators) at the INS. If
you are not from the INS but looking for general directions, this is a
very good resource:

PRs for improvement welcome. Thanks for your consideration!
